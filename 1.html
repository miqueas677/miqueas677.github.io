  <p>Lionel Messi, born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, is widely regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time. Standing 5'7", he plays as a forward or attacking midfielder and currently stars for Inter Miami CF after a legendary career with FC Barcelona. He has won 8 Ballon d'Or awards more than any other player and holds the record for most goals in a calendar year (91 in 2012). Messi has scored over 100 goals for Argentina, winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2021 Copa America. With 4 UEFA Champions League titles and 10 La Liga championships, hes also Barcelonas all-time top scorer with over 670 goals. His unmatched dribbling, vision, playmaking, and consistency over more than 15 years set him apart. Messi isn't just a scorer, hes a team player with over 300 career assists, shining in the biggest games while staying humble and dedicated. His combination of skill, success, and character is why many believe hes the best to ever play the game.</p>
